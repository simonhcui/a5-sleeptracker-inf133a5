--Aim for no more than a few sentences for each of the following questions.--


5. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom? Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
I tried to design an app based on my background. I am a fan of simple design that gets to the point without wasting the user's time 
(Hence why there is no fluff like a title screen). I have also only used Android devices before so I designed my app for neither iOS or Android 
specifically because I understand some Android specific design choices but don't have a clue as to how iOS apps should look based off lack of experience.


6. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
After sleeping, record the time the person went to bed, and when he or she woke up the next day. I chose this method over marking when to start logging
when the person actually went to bed and then marking when he or she woke up when the person actually does because it can be
easy to forget to mark this off right when someone wakes up.
Overnight sleep is logged on the Sleep Logger page. The format is MM/DD/YYYY HH/MM/SS

7. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A person can log sleepiness whenever they want by navigating to the Record Sleepiness page. Here he or she will 
record their sleepiness based off the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and both that score and the exact time that the score was recorded are logged.


8. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
There are two separate pages for viewing the logged data. One for viewing logged overnight sleep, the other for viewing logged sleepiness over the day.
I separated the two because I felt that design wise, having just one page for viewing all of the logged data in the app would become too cluttered 
to remain pleasing to the eye.  



9. Which feature did you add for A5--using a native device resource, backing up logged data to Firebase, or both? If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
Backing up logged data to Firebase. 


10. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
Added colors to ion-toolbar for all pages. They give the app a little more personality and more importantly, the colors correlate with the pages that they are in 
reference to (Sleep Logger has same color as View Logged Overnight Sleep. Record Sleepiness has same color as View Logged Sleepiness page)
